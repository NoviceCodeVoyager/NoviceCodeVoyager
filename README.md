# 👋 Hello, I'm NoviceCodeVoyager!

I'm an independent learner passionate about development, currently based in Seoul, South Korea.   
I have experience in the development field at an IT company. Currently, I am taking a break to address the areas where I feel lacking in my knowledge and focus on self-directed learning and skill improvement.

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning

I am currently consolidating my overall knowledge and exploring a variety of topics rather than narrowing down into a specific field.   
I am learning about different types of algorithms that power code execution and studying various elements that constitute the web.   
My primary interest lies in understanding the comprehensive aspects of web development, spanning from frontend to backend, and cultivating a holistic perspective.

## 😌Stress Relief Breaks

When I'm not coding or engaged in coding-related studies, I prefer to unwind and relieve stress through gaming or listening to music.   
I believe music is an ideal companion for both work and play. Whether diving into intense FPS battles or immersive RPG adventures, I love exploring virtual worlds and the storytelling possibilities games offer.
